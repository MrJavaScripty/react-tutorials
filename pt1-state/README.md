# Welcome to your first React + Vite App

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.


[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh

This project focuses on the React Setup, State and Props.
